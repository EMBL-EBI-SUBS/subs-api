This guide describes how to start submitting data.

To follow these steps, you will need to have setup an account and have a valid API token. This is covered in a
<<guide_accounts_and_logging_in.adoc#,separate guide>>.

== Overview

The submissions process has a few steps:

 . Create a submission
 . Add documents describing your work to the submission
 . Check that the documents pass our validation rules, making corrections if necessary
 . Submit the finalised submission

After the final step, we will send the data to the appropriate EMBL-EBI data archives. Some of our archives perform
additional curation on the data and may request changes to the submitted data. As data is successfully deposited with
each archive, we will record the accessions provided by the archives. You will always be able to get an update on
the deposition progress and the accessions.

We will step through the steps required to do this, with links to the details in the reference documentation.

== Start from the root

The API root provides a list of links, in the http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL JSON] format. Following
 these links takes you to other parts of the API. You can follow chains of links to access any part of the API.

NOTE: Visit the <<ref_root_endpoint.adoc#,reference documention>> to get the details of using the API root

include::{snippets}/root-endpoint/curl-request.adoc[]

You don't need to worry about most of those links for now, we'll learn about them as we go.

NOTE: We recommend that you always start from the API root and follow the _links_ given in the `_links` section of the
response, instead of relying on hard-coding each API endpoint. This will insulate you from future changes to the
submission system architecture or URL structure.

== Pick a team

Every submission is owned by a _team_. A team is a group of people, working together on the same data. How you use this
is up to you. You could create a team for just yourself, everyone in a lab, or one for all collaborators on a project.

Teams are created and administed through the AAP system. Our <<guide_accounts_and_logging_in.adoc#,guide>> provides a
starting point on how to do this.

From the root endpoint, follow the link labelled `userTeams`. This will show all that teams that you are a member of:

include::{snippets}/get-teams/http-response.adoc[]

Each team record will include a block of `_links`. Following the `submissions` link will give you a list of all the
submissions owned by this team.

NOTE: You can find more details on teams in the <<ref_teams.adoc#,reference documentation>>.

== Creating a submission

From team, find the link labelled `submissions:create`. Making a `POST` request to this URL with an empty document will
create a new submission:

include::{snippets}/create-submission/curl-request.adoc[]

NOTE: Using a `POST` request indicates that you want a new thing to be created. Each HTTP verb has a different meaning,
you should always use the correct verb. These are described in the <<ref_overview.adoc#_http_verbs,reference overview>>.

If successful, this will return a JSON object with links to parts of the submission:

include::{snippets}/create-submission/http-response.adoc[]

NOTE: You can also give each submission a name, to help you remember what it is intended for. See the
<<ref_submissions.adoc#,reference documentation>> for more details.

== Finding your submission again

Once you have created a submission, you can find it again through two routes.

From the <<ref_root_endpoint.adoc#,API root>>, you can follow the link `userSubmissions` link to get a list
of all submissions that you can access.

Alternatively, you can follow the link `userTeams`, find a team and then follow the `submissions` link for it.

== Adding documents to a submission

The next step is to follow the `contents` link from the submission. This will give you a set of links to get things in the
submission, or add things to it.

The response gives links to URLs where you can get all the items that are part of the submission, and links that you can
use when adding items to a submission  - these end with `:create`.

ifdef::sample[]

We'll start by adding samples. It's a good template for adding anything to a submission - while the details in the
documents change, the process is the same across all types of document.

=== Naming samples (and everything else)

Samples, like all the documents that you add to a submission need to have an _alias_. This field is the name used for
the record within the submission system. Each alias should be unique within the records of that type owned by a team.
Using an alias for a second time in another submission will cause the record to be overwritten.

=== Requirements for sample documents

The description of a sample should normally include a taxonomic code to describe the species classification. This must
be an entry from the taxonomy database curated at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/[NCBI]. EMBL-EBI provide a
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browse/taxonomy-service[service] to search for and look up taxonomic entries, and this is used
when the submission system checks sample documents.

We will accept sample records for display in https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/[BioSamples] without a taxon ID, but
you will not be able to use the sample record when submitting data to the experimental data archives without a taxon ID.
In addition, if you use a taxon ID, it must be one marked as 'submittable' in the taxonomy database.

The structure of the sample document is shown in the <<ref_samples.adoc#,reference documentation>>.

=== Adding a sample record to a submission

From the `submission:contents` resource, use the `samples:create` link to make a POST request. The sample document
should be the request body.

include::{snippets}/create-sample/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a response to show that the sample record has been created, with links to other

include::{snippets}/create-sample/http-response.adoc[]

endif::sample[]

== Validation

Documents are checked at two points during submission:

 1. When sent to the API server, through `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` requests. At this point the sent must be match the
 expected syntax, and be identified with an alias.
 2. Once accepted by the API server, it is sent to a suite of validators to ensure it meets the requirements of the
 relevant archives or project.

If a document does not pass the first stage of validation, the response will have a `400 Bad Request`
<<ref_overview.adoc#_http_status_codes,status code>>. The response body will include an error message.

The second stage of validation is more in depth and takes longer. Clients can check for `ValidationResults` for each
submitted document, and for a submission. You will not be able to complete a submission until validation
has completed and any problems identified have been dealt with.

Use the `validationResult` link from sample (or any other submitted document) to see its validation results. This may be
 pending, in which case you can poll for completion.

You can find more information about validation results in the <<ref_validation_+results.adoc#,reference documentation>>.

=== Updating a sample

If the validation process identifies any problems with your sample, you can change it. The simplest way is to make a
`PUT` request to <<ref_samples.adoc#_update_a_sample,replace the whole record>>. Alternatively, you can make a `PATCH`
request to <<ref_samples.adoc#_patch_a_sample,change part of the sample document>>. In either case, use the `self:update`
link, available for the sample.

When you update a document we will run the it through the validation process again.

=== Deleting a sample

Alternatively, you may decide to remove a sample from a submission. In this case, make a `DELETE` request to the
`self:delete` link.

ifdef::project[]

== Adding a project

Projects have a release date, title and description. As with samples, they are created using `POST` requests:

include::{snippets}/create-project/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a response to show that the project record has been created:

include::{snippets}/create-project/http-response.adoc[]

A submission can only have one project, so once you have added a project to a submission the `projects:create` link
will not be available from the submission contents endpoint:

include::{snippets}/submission-contents-post-project-creation/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/submission-contents-post-project-creation/http-response.adoc[]


endif::project[]

ifdef::study[]

== Adding a study

Experimental data are grouped into _studies_. Studies should describe the motivation and summarise the design for the
study. Like samples, studies are identified by an alias, and have a number of attributes. Studies should always
reference a project.

As with samples, study records are created using `POST` requests:

include::{snippets}/create-study/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a response to show that the study record has been created:

include::{snippets}/create-study/http-response.adoc[]

endif::study[]

ifdef::assay[]

== Adding assays

Assay documents describes the processes performed on the sample to produce data. For example, this could be library
preparation and sequencing for an NGS study. If you are familiar with the ENA SRA submission system, an assay is equivalent to an Experiment.

include::{snippets}/create-assay/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a response to show that the assay record has been created:

include::{snippets}/create-assay/http-response.adoc[]

endif::assay[]

ifdef::assayData[]

== Adding assay data

If you are familiar with the ENA SRA submission system, assay data is equivalent to a Run.

include::{snippets}/create-assay-data/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a response to show that the assay record has been created:

include::{snippets}/create-assay-data/http-response.adoc[]

endif::assayData[]

== Finalising your submission

Once you have added all your documents to the submission and they have been validated, you can finalise it and send them
to the archives. You do this by changing the submission status. To get to the submission status, follow the
`submissionStatus` link from the submission, then the `self` link.

Follow the `availableStatuses` link from submission or submissionStatus to see the statuses that are currently available.
Available statuses are affected by whether or not validation has finished and the current status of the submission.

include::{snippets}/available-status-report/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a response to show that the status can now be updated to 'Submitted':

include::{snippets}/available-status-report/http-response.adoc[]

You can change the submission status to 'Submitted', using a `PUT` request:

include::{snippets}/change-submission-status/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a response to show that the status has been changed:

include::{snippets}/change-submission-status/http-response.adoc[]

This will also lock the submission, so you cannot make further changes while we broker the data into the archives.

== Tracking progress

Once you've finalised your submission, we will send it off to the relevant data archives. You can see how
that's progressing - e.g. has a study been received an accession yet?. There are several ways to do this.

Firstly, you can see the all details by following the `processingStatuses` link from the submission:

include::{snippets}/page-progress-reports/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/page-progress-reports/http-response.adoc[]

You can also see summaries of the same information.

Summarised by status (follow the `processingStatusSummary` link from the submission):

include::{snippets}/summary-progress-reports/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/summary-progress-reports/http-response.adoc[]

Summarised by status and type (follow the `typeProcessingStatusSummary` link from the submission)

include::{snippets}/type-summary-progress-reports/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/type-summary-progress-reports/http-response.adoc[]

You can also follow the `processingStatus` link from sample (or any other part of the submission) to see the current
progress for an individual document.

== The end?

Once all documents in a submission have been completely archived, the submission is considered complete.

If you need to update the information of any of the records submitted, create an new submission and add a document,
following the same process as before. Using the same team and alias will ensure that the archive records are updated.

== When things go wrong

Successful requests will return a HTTP status code in `20X` range
(see the <<submission_api.adoc#_http_status_codes,reference docs>>). When something goes wrong, there will be an
error message to explain the problem. There's an explanation of each error type in the <<submission_api.adoc#_errors,reference docs>>.

Errors can normally be resolved by correcting the content or format of your request. Please get in touch if the cause
of the problem isn't clear or you need further assistance, by e-mailing our help desk - submission-help@ebi.ac.uk.
