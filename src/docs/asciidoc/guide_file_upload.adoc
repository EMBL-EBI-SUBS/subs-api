This guide describes how to upload files to our submission system. It is intended for people submitting data programatically.

== Overview and prerequisites

We use the https://tus.io/[tus protocol] for resumable file uploads. Several upload client implementations are available from the https://tus.io/implementations.html[tus.io website]. The examples in this guide use a python client, https://github.com/cenkalti/tus.py[tus.py]. You can either download and install tus.py and follow these examples, or adapt them for the tus implementation you choose.


To follow these steps, you will also need to have setup an account and have a valid AAP token (covered 
<<guide_accounts_and_logging_in.adoc#,here>>), and created a submission (covered <<guide_getting_started.adoc#_creating_a_submission,here>>). You will need the token and submission ID to upload files.

== How to upload a file

Use the command line interface of https://github.com/cenkalti/tus.py[tus.py] to send your file upload request, using the submission ID and AAP token:

[source,bash,subs={markup-in-source}]
----
tus-upload --chunk-size 1024000 --metadata filename <destination_file_name.cram> --metadata submissionID '<your_submission_id>' --metadata jwtToken â€˜<your_jwt_token>' <source_test_filename> {file_upload_server_url}
----

What the parameters mean:

- chunk-size: this number defines how much data is uploaded in a single take in bytes.

NOTE: If the user have a reliable internet connection, then bigger values would mean a faster upload.
On the other side, if the internet connection is not reliable, then using smaller values would mean a safer upload.

- metadata
  * filename: the name of the file at its destination
  * submissionID: the ID of the submission you would like the file to be associated with
  * jwtToken: your generated JWT token from the previous step
- source_test_filename: the name of the file you would like to upload


NOTE: You could use any other tus-client, but the important thing is that
you need to provide the following parameters as metadata: *filename*, *submissionID*, *jwtToken*.
They are mandatory parameters.

== How to get a list of files by a given submission

Once you have uploaded at least a file, you can find it through two routes.

From your submission page you could follow the contents link and then the files link.

Alternatively, you can follow the link <<ref_root_endpoint.adoc#,API root>>, you can follow the link userSubmissions link to get a list of all submissions that you can access.
From that page you would have to follow your submission link and repeat the above described route to get to the contents page.

From the contents page you can get the list of files by the given submission to execute the below request:

include::{snippets}/get-files-by-submissionID/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return the list of the uploaded file by the given submission.

include::{snippets}/get-files-by-submissionID/http-response.adoc[]

== How to query an uploaded file

Once you got to the list of files page you can follow a file link in the _embedded section of a file under `_links.self.href` link.

include::{snippets}/get-file/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return the resource of the selected file.

include::{snippets}/get-file/http-response.adoc[]

== Update an already uploaded file

You can not update a file that has been uploaded. If you would like to replace the uploaded file,
then first you have to <<guide_file_upload.adoc#_how_to_delete_an_uploaded_file,delete>> it
and then you have to <<guide_file_upload.adoc#_how_to_upload_a_file,upload>> it again.

== How to delete an uploaded file

If you would like to delete an already uploaded file from our submission service,
then you have to go to the <<guide_file_upload.adoc#_how_to_get_a_list_of_files_by_a_given_submission,list of files>> page,
select the file you would like to delete and send a DELETE HTTP request with the URL of the selected file.

include::{snippets}/delete-file/curl-request.adoc[]

The successful response will have and empty body and the status code should be 204, No content.

include::{snippets}/delete-file/http-response.adoc[]

== Checksum generation and comparision

At the end of the file upload process our pipeline calculates the MD5 checksum of every uploaded file.
Depending on the file size it could take from a couple of seconds till couple of minutes
(in case of really-really huge files) to calculate this value.
If you have already generated your own checksum you could compare it with our checksum.

To get the generated checksum you have to go to the
<<guide_file_upload.adoc#_how_to_query_an_uploaded_file,file's page>>.
If the file status is `READY_FOR_ARCHIVE` then you should see a `checksum` field with the generated value.
