== How to upload a file

1. Generate a new JWT (API) token to use with the file upload request. See above.
2. Use the command line interface of the installed python client to send your file upload request.

[source,bash,subs={markup-in-source}]
----
tus-upload --chunk-size 1024000 --metadata name <destination_file_name.cram> --metadata submissionID '<your_submission_id>' --metadata jwtToken â€˜<your_jwt_token>' <source_test_filename> {file_upload_server_url}
----

Where the parameters are:

- chunk-size: this number defines how much data is uploaded in a single take in bytes.

NOTE: If the user have a reliable internet connection, then bigger values would mean a faster upload.
On the other side, if the internet connection is not reliable, then using smaller values would mean a safer upload.

- metadata
  * name: the name of the file at its destination
  * submissionID: the ID of the submission you would like the file to be associated with
  * jwtToken: your generated JWT token from the previous step
- source_test_filename: the name of the file you would like to upload


NOTE: You could use any other tus-client, but the important thing is that
you need to provide the following parameters as metadata: *name*, *submissionID*, *jwtToken*.
They are mandatory parameters.

You can not update a file that has been uploaded. If you would like to replace the uploaded file,
then first you have to <<guide_file_upload.adoc#_how_to_delete_an_uploaded_file,delete>> it
and then you have to <<guide_file_upload.adoc#_how_to_upload_a_file,upload>> it again.
