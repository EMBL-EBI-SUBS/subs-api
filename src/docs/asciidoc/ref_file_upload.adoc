== How to upload a file

1. Generate a new JWT (API) token to use with the file upload request. See above.
2. Use the command line interface of the installed python client to send your file upload request.

[source,bash,subs={markup-in-source}]
----
tus-upload --chunk-size 1024000 --metadata name <destination_file_name.cram> --metadata submissionID '<your_submission_id>' --metadata jwtToken â€˜<your_jwt_token>' '<source_test_filename>' {file_upload_server_url}
----

Where the parameters are:

- chunk-size: this number defines how much data is uploaded in a single take in bytes.

NOTE: If the user have a reliable internet connection, then bigger values would mean a faster upload.
On the other side, if the internet connection is not reliable, then using smaller values would mean a safer upload.

- metadata
  * name: the name of the file at its destination
  * submissionID: the ID of the submission you would like the file to be associated with
  * jwtToken: your generated JWT token from the previous step
- source_test_filename: the name of the file you would like to upload


NOTE: You could use any other tus-client, but the important thing is that
you need to provide the following parameters as metadata: *name*, *submissionID*, *jwtToken*.
They are mandatory parameters.

== Update an already uploaded file

You can not update a file that has been uploaded. If you would like to replace the uploaded file,
then first you have to <<guide_file_upload.adoc#_how_to_delete_an_uploaded_file,delete>> it
and then you have to <<guide_file_upload.adoc#_how_to_upload_a_file,upload>> it again.

== Globus file uploading

It is also possible to upload files to DSP via https://www.globus.org/[Globus]. Due to infrastructure limitations
file uploading through tus.io may seem slow, especially with large files. At EBI, Globus is among a few other
supported technologies that allow for high speed file transfers. In order to use this for uploading files to DSP,
users will need to register an account with Globus. Please see the *For researchers* section in the
https://www.globus.org/get-started[getting started] guide for more information.

=== Requesting Globus share

To begin uploading files, users will first need to request a Globus share. A share is basically a dedicated folder that
DSP creates for the requesting user that they can upload their files into. The following REST API is used for requesting
a share:

=== Request
include::{snippets}/create-globus-share/curl-request.adoc[]

=== Response
include::{snippets}/create-globus-share/http-response.adoc[]

NOTE: 1# Globus shares are a limited resource. In order to keep number of shares small, DSP *reuses* user's existing shares for
all of their submissions that are still open i.e. that have the status DRAFT.

NOTE: 2# Users may think that it is ok to request a share just once but that is not the case. This share request REST API not
only creates a share but also *registers* a submission with the new or a pre-existing share. If a submission is not registered
with a share then DSP would never look into user's Globus directory for files that are referenced in the submission.

This endpoint returns a web link that can be opened in the browser to access the Globus file manager. This
https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/#the_file_manager[guide] explains the transfer process in detail. This link then also
becomes available under <<ref_submissions.adoc#_get_a_submission,submission details>> should the users
wish to access it again later.

=== Notifying DSP about uploaded files

Since Globus is an external third-party system, it is difficult for DSP to know when a file has finished uploading. It is
therefore the responsibility of the user to let DSP know whenever that happens. The following REST API
acts as a way of sending notification to DSP about such files:

=== Request
include::{snippets}/notify-globus-uploadedfiles/curl-request.adoc[]

=== Response
include::{snippets}/notify-globus-uploadedfiles/http-response.adoc[]

This is a simple endpoint that will just return an empty 200 OK response. After calling this endpoint, users can query either the
<<ref_validation_results.adoc#_fetch_validation_results_for_a_single_document,validation results>> or
<<ref_file_upload.adoc#_how_to_get_a_list_of_files_by_a_given_submission,files>> APIs to see if DSP was able to locate
the files or not.

NOTE: Calling the notify endpoint will remove the files from user's Globus directory and move them to an internal staging area.
Users are hereby advised not to get confused if they notice files disappearing from their Globus directory. If in doubt, use
DSP's files API to see whether or not it appears in the list of files DSP has identified for a particular submission.

=== Share removal upon completion

DSP automatically deletes the share as soon as it's last registered submission gets completed. If there are any files
present in the directory at that time then they are deleted as well.

NOTE: Users are advised to start uploading files after they have registered their submission by calling the share request endpoint.
