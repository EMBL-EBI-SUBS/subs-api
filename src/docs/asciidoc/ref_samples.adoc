== What are samples?

The definition of a sample is intentionally flexible in order to accommodate a wide range of uses. Typically, each
sample record corresponds to a discrete physical object that is composed of live biological material.

In most cases sample entities are self-evident; such as a blood sample, cell culture or an individual organism.
However, a sample can also be an environmental sample (e.g. for meta-genomic analysis), a hybrid between two species,
parasite infected cell culture, etc.

== Minimal requirements

These fields must be filled out for all samples:

* alias
* title
* releaseDate in YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. `"2017-12-12"`

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/[BioSamples] will release your sample information on or after the release date.

In addition, most of our data archives also require a taxonomy entry, to classify the species or sample type. This should
be given as a taxon ID. You can search for taxon IDs through the
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/search?query=xenograft[ENA web page], or
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browse/taxonomy-service[API].

* taxonId

NOTE: Please note that not all taxon are considered acceptable for submitted data. For example
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/taxonomy/v1/taxon/tax-id/9443[primates] is not accepted, but
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/taxonomy/v1/taxon/tax-id/9606[humans] is.
