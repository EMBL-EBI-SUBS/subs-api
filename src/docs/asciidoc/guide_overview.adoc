This section of the documentation is intended to get you started writing applications to work with the submissions API.
We'll cover everything you need to know, from authentication, to submission and validation.

We suggest that you start with <<guide_accounts_and_logging_in.adoc#,Setting up a user account and logging in>>, then
move on to <<guide_getting_started.adoc#,Getting started with the submissions API>>.
