= Validation results
:docinfo: shared

== Overview

Validation results provide feedback on the documents you have submitted. They are updated each time you create or change
a document. The results take a little time to generate, so we provide a status to inform you if the validation process
has finished.

You cannot make changes to validation results, they are only changed when you update the documents in the submission.

== Fetch validation results for a single document

You can get validation results for any submittable, by following the `validationResult` link:

=== Request

=== Response

== Fetch validation results for all documents in a submission

You can get all the validation results for a submission, by following the `validationResults` from the submission.
