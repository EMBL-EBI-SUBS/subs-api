== Checklists

Templates help users provide bulk data (e.g. sampeles, assays), using familiar tools.
Users can download spreadsheets by using the `spreadsheet-csv-download` link in their browser.

== Spreadsheet upload

Users can supply information by downloading a spreadsheet template, filling in the data and uploading the completed spreadsheet.

This is currently available for samples.

.Steps to upload a spreadsheet
. Select a template
. Download template file
. Open template in spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel)
. Fill in spreadsheet values
. Save spreadsheet in `.csv` format
. Select the same template, upload to the API. This will give you a sheet resource
. The sheet will be parsed by the system and loaded into the database (e.g. as sample records)
. Progress and errors will be recorded in the sheet resource
. Sheets will be cleaned up within a few days of them being completed.


=== Uploading a CSV file

We'll use a small csv file in this example:

.my-samples.csv
[source,csv]
alias,taxon id,taxon,height,units
s1,9606,Homo sapiens,1.7,meters
s2,9606,Homo sapiens,1.7,meters

NOTE: If using curl, you can use the --data-binary parameter to pass file contents more efficiently:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'https://submission-dev.ebi.ac.uk/api/submissions/faa8fbef-3f95-4363-bc78-a0c3ccb56a81/spreadsheet?checklistId=simple-sample-template' -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: text/csv' -H 'Accept: application/hal+json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' --data-binary @my-samples.csv
