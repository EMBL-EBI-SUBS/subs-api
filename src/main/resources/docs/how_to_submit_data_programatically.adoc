== Overview

This document will take you through the steps required to submit descriptive data (often called "metadata") using the
https://www.ebi.ac.uk[EMBL-EBI] submission system. EMBL-EBI provide a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS[hypermedia]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[REST API] to accept descriptive data from submitters using
standard HTTP requests.

We present examples using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL[curl] to interact with the server.

The 

== Log in

*TODO* we will add a section describing how to get an authorisation token and what to do with it.

== Fetch the API root

We recommend that clients start from the root endpoint and follow the `_links` given in the response payload, instead of
hardcoding each API endpoint.

include::{snippets}/root-endpoint/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a long list of links, in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL JSON] format:

include::{snippets}/root-endpoint/http-response.adoc[]

You don't need to worry about most of those links for now, we'll learn about them as we go.

== Pick a team

Every submission is owned by a _team_. At this stage of development, the API doesn't restrict what team you use.
A future update will add support for team membership and administration. Until then, you can use any team name you like.

A team object is structured like this:

`{"name" : "my-team"}`

At present, you also need to provide a submitter object when creating a submission. In future versions this will be
taken from your log in information, but for now you need to provide a submitter object:

`{"email": "alice@example.com"}`

== Create a submission

Using the link labelled `submissions:create`, `POST` a document containing a team and a submitter to create
a submission:

include::{snippets}/create-submission/curl-request.adoc[]

If successful, this will return a JSON object with links to parts of the submission:

include::{snippets}/create-submission/http-response.adoc[]

The `location` header has the URL for the created submission. You will need this when adding things to the submission.

== Add samples

Using the link from the submission labelled `samples:create`, `POST` a sample object:

include::{snippets}/create-sample/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a response:

include::{snippets}/create-sample/http-response.adoc[]

Note that the sample record needs to include a

== Validation

Descriptive data is checked at two points during submission:

 1. When sent to the API server, through `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` requests. At this point the sent must be match the expected syntax, and be identified with an alias.
 2. Once accepted by the API server, it is sent to a suite of validators to ensure it meets the requirements of the relevant archives or project.

The second stage of validation is more in depth, and takes longer. Clients can poll for `ValidationResults` for each
submitted document, and for a submission. You will not be able to complete a submission until validation
have completed and no errors have been found.

TODO add example of getting validation results

== Updating a sample

If you want to change a sample record after you've created it, you should use a `PUT` request to replace the record:

include::{snippets}/update-sample/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/patch-sample/http-response.adoc[]

Updating a document will cause it to be re-validated, using the procesesses described above.

== When things go wrong

Successful requests will return a HTTP status code in `20X` range
(see the <<submission_api.adoc#_http_status_codes,reference docs>>). When something goes wrong, there will be an
error message to explain the problem. There's an explanation of each error type in the <<submission_api.adoc#_errors,reference docs>>.

Errors can normally be resolved by correcting the content or format of your request. Please get in touch if the
