== Overview

This describes the resources that make up the EMBL-EBI submissions API.
If you have any queries or requests, please contact mailto:subs-help@ebi.ac.uk[support].

All API access is over HTTP, and accessed from `http://www.ebi.ac.uk/submissions/api`.
All data is sent and received as JSON.

=== HTTP Verbs

This API aims to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each action


[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Verb
|Description


|`GET`|Used for retrieving resources
|`POST`|Used for creating resources
|`PATCH`|Used to modify a resource
|`PUT`|Used for replacing resources
|`DELETE`|Used for deleting resources
|`OPTIONS`|Can be used to determine which verbs can be used for a resource
|`HEAD`|Returns whether a resource is available

|Status code
|Description


|`200 OK`|The request completed successfully
|`201 Created`|Returned after successfully creating a new resource with a `POST` request
|`204 No Content`|Returned after a request successfully deleted a resource.
|`304 Not Modified`|Returned in response to a conditional `GET` request, when the resource has not been modified

|===

=== Authentication

TODO, pending implementation details from AAP. Get a https://jwt.io/[JWT] token from AAP. Include it as the Authorization header in
requests to the submissions API.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://www.ebi.ac.uk/submissions/api' -i -H 'Accept: application/hal+json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ'
----

The `Authorization` header has been omitted from all further example requests, for brevity.

=== Errors

There are several types of client errors on API calls that receive request bodies.

* Sending invalid JSON will result in a `400 Bad Request` response
include::{snippets}/invalid-json/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/invalid-json/http-response.adoc[]
* Sending the wrong type of JSON values (e.g. array where an object is expected) will result in a `400 Bad Request` response.
include::{snippets}/json-array-instead-of-object/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/json-array-instead-of-object/http-response.adoc[]
* Sending invalid fields will result in a `400 Bad Request` response.
include::{snippets}/invalid-submission/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/invalid-submission/http-response.adoc[]

All error objects have properties so that your client can tell what the problem is. There's also an error code
so that you know what is wrong with the field.

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Error name
|Description

|missing_field |This means a required field has not been set
|invalid |This means the contens of this field are invalid
|resource_locked |The resource cannot be changed
|already_exists |Another resource with the same value already exists

=== Hypermedia

This API uses hypermedia, and resources include links to other resources in their responses. Responses are in
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. API users should
not build links themselves, but should use these links to navigate between resources. Clients should discover resources
and available actions by consuming the `_links`.

Links may be returned in templated form, requiring expansion prior to use. This is primarily true for search resources.
Templated links follow https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570[RFC6570].

Link naming follows a consistent pattern.

* Each resource includes a `self` link. This is the canonical link to the resource, although there may be others
* Individual resources are named with the type name, e.g. `submission`
* Collection resources are named with the plural of the type name in camel case, e.g. `submissions`, `assayData`
* Search resources are named with the plural of the type name in camel case, with a `:search` suffix, e.g. `submissions:search`
* Where a collection resource accepts `POST` requests to create a new resource, a link will have the `:create` suffix, e.g. `submissions:create`
* Where an individual resource accepts `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` requests, a link will have the `:update` suffix, e.g. `self:update`

=== Collection resources

Collection resources represent a set of individual resources, often presented as summary representations. Each element
will have its own `_links` element. Following the `self` link from one of these elements will bring you to the
detailed representation.

==== Summary representations

When fetching a list of resources, the response will often include a subset of the attributes for that resource.
For performance reasons some attributes are excluded from the summary representation. These are available from the detailed representation.

Example: When you get a list of samples, you get the summary representation of each sample.

===== Request
include::{snippets}/samples/by-submission/curl-request.adoc[]

===== Response
include::{snippets}/samples/by-submission/http-response.adoc[]

==== Paging

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 20 items by default. You can specify a specific pages with the
`?page` parameter. Page number is 1-based and in the absence of a `?page` parameter the first page is returned. You can
also set a custom page size with the `?size` parameter, up to a maximum of 500.

Links will be provided for the first, last, next and previous pages, where such pages exist.

=== Individual resources

==== Detailed representations

When fetching an individual resource, the response typically includes all attributes for that resource.
Nested resources may be included under the `_embedded` key.

Example: When you fetch an individual sample, you get the detailed representation.

===== Request

include::{snippets}/samples/fetch-one/curl-request.adoc[]

===== Response

include::{snippets}/samples/fetch-one/http-response.adoc[]

==== Conditional requests

Most individual resources have entity tags and modification timestamps. This can be used to
make conditional requests, allowing clients to minimise bandwidth use and avoiding collisions with other
clients.

The format for conditional headers is specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3[RFC7232 section 3].
Note that only `If-Match`, `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are supported.

===== Entity tags

Where entity tags are available, `ETag` values are included in the response headers. Updates to a resource
cause the ETag to change. You can make subsequent requests conditional on the resource currently matching or
not matching the last ETag value you hold.

For example, you can conditionally `GET` a resource if its `ETag` value has changed:
include::{snippets}/conditional-fetch-etag-get-if-none-match/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/conditional-fetch-etag-get-if-none-match/http-response.adoc[]

You could `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` a resource if its `ETag` value has not changed:
include::{snippets}/conditional-delete-if-etag-match/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/conditional-delete-if-etag-match/http-response.adoc[]


===== Last modified dates

Where modification timestamps are available, `Last-Modified` values are included in the response headers. You can make
subsequent requests conditional on the resource currently matching or not matching the last modified value you
hold.

You can conditionally `GET` a resource if it has changed since a specified time:
include::{snippets}/conditional-fetch-if-modified-since/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/conditional-fetch-if-modified-since/http-response.adoc[]

The use of `ETag` is preferred over `Last-Modified`, as last modified dates are limited to a resolution of
one second. Relying on the `Last-Modified` header is vulnerable to changes that occur in the same second.

=== Search and query resources

Search resources expose a list of all the query methods available for a collection. These will be templated links
that can be expanded to query for resources. The example below illustrates the search resources for samples.

==== Links

== Usage

When submitting data to EMBL-EBI archives, you should start by `GET`-ing the root endpoint. From here, you should follow
links to find a list of domains you can use. Choose one and create a new submission for it, by `POST`-ing to the
submissions collection.

Once you have a submission, create new resources for samples, assays, etc, by `POST`-ing to the appropriate collection
resource. Update these resources with `PUT` or `PATCH`.

Once you have created all your resources, you can submit the submission to the archives by changing the submission
status to `Submitted`. The submissions system will add the resources to the archive databases.

You can query the system to find the status of each item in a submission, and any accessions assigned by the archives.

TODO needs a rewrite + extend to cover discovering previously submitted records.
TODO needs updating once we have validation.

== Resources

Here we list the resources available though this API.

=== Root endpoint

You can issue a `GET` request to the root endpoint to get all the entry points into the API.

==== Request

include::{snippets}/root-endpoint/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response

include::{snippets}/root-endpoint/http-response.adoc[]

==== Links

include::{snippets}/root-endpoint/links.adoc[]

=== Domains

TODO there isn't a proper entry point for domains yet. If you know the domain name, you can access it
through this endpoint. Domains cannot be created or deleted through this API, they are controlled
through the AAP.

==== Request

include::{snippets}/get-domain/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response

include::{snippets}/get-domain/http-response.adoc[]

==== Links

include::{snippets}/get-domain/links.adoc[]


=== Submissions

`DELETE`-ing a submission will delete the submission and all resources within it e.g. studies, samples.

==== Create a submission

=== Submittable resources

Resources of these types are submittable resources:

* Analysis
* Assay
* AssayData
* BaseSubmittable
* EgaDac
* EgaDacPolicy
* EgaDataset
* Project
* Protocol
* Sample
* SampleGroup
* Study

The methods to create and update them are common between all of these types.
We will use sample as an example.

=== Status descriptions

The status description resources provide information about each status used in the system, including available status
changes and wether the resources can be changed. These resources do not accept `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE`
requests.

* release status
* submission status
* processing status
